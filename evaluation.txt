--Pre-emptive--
Each separate blink task doesn't overlap with any other ones running.
Example
Task1 ON                                              OFF
Task2                                                  ON                                               OFF
      0   10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90  100  110  120  130  140  150  160  170  180  190  200

--Time Slicing--
Each separate blink task overlaps with any other ones running, keeping to it's own one second loop.  
Example
Task1 ON                                              OFF
Task2                                                  ON                                               OFF
      0   10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90  100  110  120  130  140  150  160  170  180  190  200

168 MHz vs 100 MHz
The blinking becomes faster and the debounce timers expire sooner.
